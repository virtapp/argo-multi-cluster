## Timeline :alarm_clock:

- Introduction
- ArgoCD
- ApplicationSets
- Generators
- Demo
- Feedback

## Agenda :dart:

- In this presentation, we will discuss about how to deploy applications in an multi-cluster environment distributed across multiple clouds using ArgoCd and its native operators.

- To illustrate this, we will use a mono-repo similar to [k8s-manifests](https://github.com/work/k8s-manifests)

## ArgoCD

Hi, I am ArgoCD....üëãüèª

- ArgoCD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

- It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state.

- More at [Argocd Documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?_gl=1*vvk4hh*_ga*NTQ3Mzc3Nzc1LjE3MDE0NDI1MTA.*_ga_5Z1VTPDL73*MTcwNDgyMzc2Ny41LjEuMTcwNDgyMzgxNS4wLjAuMA..#overview)

## ApplicationSets

- Managed by the ApplicationSet kubernetes controller.
- Used for multi-cluster support and cluster multitenant support within Argo CD.
- It Automates the generation of Argo CD Applications.
- More at [Argocd Documentation: ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/)

## Generators
<!--class: default -->

Generators are responsible for generating parameters, which are then used by the ApplicationSet resource.

- More at [Argocd Documentation: Generators](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators/)

In this demo we are using following generators:
- [Matrix Generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Matrix/)
<!-- combines the parameters generated by two child generators -->
- [Git Generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Git/)
<!-- the Cluster generator produces parameters based on the list of items found within the cluster secret. -->
- [Cluster Generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Cluster/)

## Demo Time :computer:

We are trying to achieve following goals:

- Establish GitOps and IaC. (everything as configuration and code)
* Dynamic Application Provisioning to multi cluster environments.
* Simplified cloud agnostics configuration management for applications.
* Provide mechanisms for value files in DRY formatt.(Multi level overrides)
* Continuous reconciliation and parrallel deployments.

## Feedback :raising_hand:

- Questions and Answers

I am confident that there is plenty of room for improvements

Any feedback or questions are welcome.
